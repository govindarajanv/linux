Networking Basics
=================

1	check ip address of the machine
	#ip addr show
	#ip a s
	#ifconfig

2	ping google.com 5 times
	#ping -c3 google.com

3	run a network trace
	#traceroute google.com

4	Get all the hops to reach a network destination
	#tracepath google.com

5	get all listening and established connections
	#ss -a

6	get all connections with tcp sockets and portnum
	#ss -nt

7	get all connections with udp sockets and portnum
	#ss -up

8	find which network devices are attached
	#yum install NetworkManager
	#systemctl start NetworkManager
	#nmcli dev status

9	how to view transmission statistics for a network interface which comes second when you fire #ip a s
	#ip -s link show eth0

10	open UI based network manager
	#yum install NetworkManager-tui -y
	#nmtui

11	get the list of all network interfaces
	#nmcli conn show

12	Go to the configuration file of the last network interface shown in the above command
	#
13	Add a new connection with auto connect feature on the last network interface
14	Get the active network connections
15	Get the list of active devices 
16	get the list of hostnames internally resolved and external name servers referred
17	get the list of dns and ip mapping for name resolution done locally
18	get the order of DNS search, locate the configuration done for the same
19	set a transient hostname for your node
20	set a hostname that can survive the reboot
21	To retrieve entries from databases as specified in your Name Service Switch configuration /etc/nsswitch.conf
22	enable telnet service to start automatically at boot time
23	list all current rules sorted by chain
24	Disable FORWARD in iptables
25	flush the configurations in iptables
26	enable FORWARD chain in iptables
27	Disable ping on your server from another server using REJECT
28	Disable ping on your server from another server using DROP
29	locate the configuration file related to iptables
20	flush only input chain
21	flush all chains
22	save iptables configuration
23	flush and restore the iptables configuration back
24	inquire for a give rule say 'INPUT'
25	To monitor network performance
	- use netstat
	- use ss
26	check for services on a particular port using ss (take port as 22)
27	check what is running on your system and scan all ports 
28	Do ip traffic monitor
29	get details about CPU, network use
30	display the current open, closed, establish and orphaned TCP processes on the system
31	run a scan for all open ports on the system
32	list processes open by socket
33	Run the command that allows you to filter IPv4 traffic by type; show types ESTABLISHED and LISTEN
34	display the current processes, memory and network bandwidth utilization of the server
35	to run the above command every five seconds and execute only ten iterations of it before stopping.
36	check how routers are setup
	- using netstat
	- using ip command
37	Route all traffic via 192.168.1.254 gateway connected via eth0 network interface
38	Delete the above routing and confirm
39	Dynamically route ip traffic
	- use quagga
	- use CentOS 7 system as a router
40	Setup local time server
	- setup ntp server
	- query the server
	- get the stats
	- make that server to act as a local server (with local clock)
	- make firwall changes to allow this action
	- query ntp to confirm that local clock is referred
	- reboot and check if your changes survives the reboot
41	Setup one ntp client in a different server
	- this client should refer the above server for time
	- enable firewall rules to allow this bi-directional communication
	- Inquire to confirm that the client refers the above server
	- reboot and check if your changes survives the reboot
